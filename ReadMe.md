# Clemowm ReadMe Final Project
My final portfolio website has 
* Portfolio.html 
* index.css  
* index.js 
* Images folder
* ReadMe.md 

## Set up
There should be no set up to view the contents of my portfolio website. As long these docuements are located in the same place, the images as well as the other docuemnts such as the Javascript and CSS file will load into my Portfolio HTML.

## Features

### Sharing button
These buttons were made with Javascript. Each linked to a external window website, sharing my social medias with the user. All are also fixed on the screen, so they are easily located at all times.

### Contact Form
The contact form was used with Javascript as well. Saving each section of the Contact Me form, and popping up an alert message. 

### Image "gallery" 
I started with the Masonry.js we did in class and successfully coded it throughout my documents and go the javascript to work too. Then after checking it after a couple days, the CDN taken and put into my HTML reported it was messed up and now made "null" so I had to do a quick fix to allow my portfolio to be free from errors, and to work as it was intended. I deleted the MAsonry.js through my final project because of the messed up file, and then rebuilt the design gallery with a lot of div's. I then also added a feature of hovering over each image, and the opacity changing. I would like to continue to work on this website even after this class ends, and the goal is having the image be clickable and either expand the image or create text overlay to descrive the process of the design created. THe gallery is mobile accessible because of the flex box used in CSS.

### Div's and more Div's
Played around a lot with Div's not only to achieve functionality, like my image gallery and sharing button tools but for the aesthetic as well. The green background with my headshot picture was used to create a more personable portfolio experience. Offering my personality and skill as a designer and creator. 

### Logo header
I created this logo in Adobe Illustratot myself. I thought it would compliment my brand and the overall portfolio website. I played around with the div I put inside it so I could move it easier, and center it on the page. I tied it into my aesthetic of my portfolio. 

### Google Fonts
I do have some font sources in my head of the HTML. I thought these would comliment my website and make it more intentional to me and compliment the brand I was establishign for myself. I used the font names "Lato" and "Prata" 

I used this w3 schools for access to different fonts [Link](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,700|Prata)
